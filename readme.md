# Sumo Wrestling

Sumo wrestling is an an ancient Japanese sport dating back to the early 1600's. It has an amazing history of traditions and ceremonies. Sumo was originally performed to entertain the gods during festivals and has now become a interesting part of Japanese culture. The tradition and structure of such a sport I find very intriguing and I am excited to learn more about sumo wrestling as I create a web page to educate others as well. 

## Purpose

This is a school project for the Algonquin College Graphic Design Program. The purpose is to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites. I want to gain a better understanding of the coding language and the internet and websites.
