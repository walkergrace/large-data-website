# Card Sort Report

The purpose of this card sort was to determine common navigation patterns and categories for my large data-oriented website on sumo wrestlers. When doing the card sort I realized I didn't quite have enough topics broken down and would have to break them down into sub content to make it understandable and easy to navigate. 

## Specifics
The card sort was conducted by Grace Walker on September 9th, 2013 and included the following participants:

- Tirzah Wood
- Kathryn Hallet


### Cards

15 cards were used covering a broad range of applicable content for the website. The following topics were used as cards:

1. Origin of Sumo
2. History and Traditions
3. Shinto
4. Rules
5. Structure
6. Kimarite and Techniques
7. History of the Rikishi
8. Yokozuna
9. Stables
10. Fashion
11. Famous Sumo Wrestlers
12. 2013 Rikishi Stats
13. 2013 Tournament Schedule
14. Divisions
15. Shisho

## Observations

**Did the participants have any common comments?**
Both the participants found some of the terms used for the categories confusing as they didn't know what they were. Once explained they still had a hard time sorting them. I think it was mostly because some of the subjects were too broad and they needed to be broken down more so they would be easier to understand and navigate. 

**Did they have questions that stood out**
Both participants thought some of my card titles were suppose to be categories. Neither could think of more broader categories to put some of my card topics into. 

**Did they struggle with certain articles or topics** They struggled with finding differences in some of the topics to make into categories. 

**Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?** They found all the content to be similar so they both only made a few groupings.

**Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?** None of the groupings were unexpected but I had expected more groups. I think the topics and how they connected made more sense to me as I had read a bit on Sumo wrestling.

**Were the results similar to your expectations** Not quite. I had really expected more groupings

**How did you feel while watching them perform the task.** I felt intrigued as I anticipated the results of there groupings. I was really hopeful that they would help me come to a conclusion on categories for my topics.
