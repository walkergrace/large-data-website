				<h1 role="main" id="main">Sport of Sumo</h1>
					<p>The ancient sport of Sumo wrestling is still very popular in Japan today.
							It is incredibly rich in traditions and ceremony.</p>

				<h2 id="origins">Rules</h2>
					<p>The Rikishi grapple in a 15 feet diameter ring raised about 2 1/2 on a huge block of clay called a dohyo. A light sprinkling of sand is applied across the inside of the ring. Tightly wound straw bands called tawara make up the edge of the ring. For each tournament a new dohyo is created.
						<br>Five judges known as shipan site below the dohyo around the outside of th ring. The three judges are also former rikishi themseleves. A referee or gyoji, dressed in an elaborate kimono stands at the edge of the ring and officiates the bout. At the end of the bout, the gyoji points to the winner. In a particularly close bout, any of the five judges can dispute the call made by the referee. If a dispute is made then the five shipan and the gyoji consult in a mono-ii inside the ring. Today television replay determine the outcome of a match dispute.
						<br>A rikishi loses a match when any part of his body other than the bottoms of his feet touches the dohyo or when he is pushed or thrown outside of the ring. In the middle of the ring are two white lines called shikirisen. These lines are the starting points of each rikishi for each bout. When a judge gives the signal for the rikishi to fight, both rikishi crouch behind their respective shikirisen and face each other. When both rikishi place both hands clenched in fists on or behind the shikirisen, the bout begins. The tachi-ai, or initial charge, is extremely important in gaining the advantage and momentum over your opponent.
						<br>During the bout a variety of techniques can be used against the other rikishi. However hair pulling, hitting with closed fists, boxing of the ears, choking, or grabbing of the opponents mawashi in the crotch area are prohibited.
						<br>There are usually two styles of fighting a rishiki can be classified under: oshi-zumo, or a tendency to push your opponent out of the ring, and yotsu-zumo, a tendency to grab your opponent's belt and force him out of the ring. The truly best rikishi are adept at using both styles to beat their opponents. At the end of each bout, a kimarite, or winning technique, is announced informing the spectators exactly what method was used to win the bout. While there are over 60 official kimarite, only a dozen or so are seen regularly. </p>

					<p>Shinto is the native religion of Japan and is based of sets of rituals
						and ceremonies more than a belief or ethical code. Shinto itself means
						*way of the gods*. Shinto rituals date as far back as the Tumulus period
						but not until the 17th century did it begin the intense purification rituals
						that are seen in sumo today.</p>
