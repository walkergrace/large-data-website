				<h1 role="main" id="main">About Sumo</h1>
					<p>The ancient sport of Sumo wrestling is still very popular in Japan today.
							It is incredibly rich in traditions and ceremony.</p>

				<h2 id="origins">Origin of Sumo</h2>
					<p>Sumo originates back **2000** years. It was orginally performed to entertain
						the gods during festivals. Very little time is actually spend grappling,
						most of their time is spent performing ceremonies rich in Shinto tradition.</p>

				<h2 id="shinto">Shinto</h2>
					<p>Shinto is the native religion of Japan and is based of sets of rituals
						and ceremonies more than a belief or ethical code. Shinto itself means
						*way of the gods*. Shinto rituals date as far back as the Tumulus period
						but not until the 17th century did it begin the intense purification rituals
						that are seen in sumo today.</p>

					recruits, to whom the worst jobs tend to be allocated, and there is a high dropout rate at this stage. </p>

					<p>The wrestlers, or rikishi, are best known for their typical ring fighting outfit consisting of a colourful,
					silk, thick-waisted loincloth, called mawashi. But they also have a more elaborate ceremonial dress.
					It consists of an ornate apron that is inserted into the mawashi. The apron, or keshō-mawashi,
					is worn at the ring entering ceremony.These gorgeous embroidered aprons are very expensive.
					They are usually paid for by a sponsor or one of the rikishi’s support groups. I had expected that all the aprons
					would depict traditional Japanese scenes, but that is not always the case. Sometimes the sponsor’s product will be
					featured and foreign rikishi sometimes wear a keshō-mawashi with their national flag. Some aprons even show funny
					pictures or scenes inspired by modern popular culture. Others refer to the wrestler’s ring name.
					The keshō-mawashi with a more ‘typical Japanese’ feel to them seemed the most difficult to find. Ironically it is
					Bulgarian wrestler Aoiyama who provides us with a traditional Japanese scene based on a woodblock print.
					Below is another keshō-mawashi based on a woodblock print by Hokusai, worn by Okinoumi. The choice of design might
					refer to his ring name, which means ‘the sea of Oki’. Oki-shotō or Oki islands is the island group where he was born.
					Also very Japanese but not quite what one would expect from a tough sumo wrestler: a design with cherry blossom,
					worn by Osaka-born rikishi Goeido. Some designs draw inspiration from a very different aspect of Japanese culture: manga.
					Have a look at this funny design worn by Ikioi. Estonian rikishi Baruto pokes fun at himself with a cute caricature.
					He also has an inception thing going on, where his image on the keshō-mawashi is wearing a keshō-mawashi with his image
					(it looks less confusing than it sounds). The most surprising reference to popular culture that I saw was on Takayasu’s
					keshō-mawashi. It features an image of Charlie Chaplin. I wonder what the story behind it is.</p>

				<h2 id="ceremony">Ceremony</h2>
					<p>The first ceremony of the day is the dohyo-iri, or ring ceremony performed by Juryo and Makuuchi rikishi before
					their bouts begin. The rikishi are grouped into two groups—East and West—and each group takes a turn entering the ring.
					The lowest-ranked rikishi enters first and walks a complete circle around the ring followed by the other rikishi in
					ascending order according the rank. Before the individual rikishi enter the ring, they are introduced to the spectators.
					Once the last rikishi in the group has been introduced, the rikishi, who are facing the spectators, turn inward and face
					 each other around the ring. After clapping their hands once, they raise their right hand, lift their kesho-mawashi
					 (decorative aprons created for the ring ceremony), and finally raise both hands in unison. This tradition goes back to
					 the samurai days and represents the rikishi showing each other that none is armed. During the Makuuchi ring ceremony,
					 the Yokozuna are notably absent from the group as they must perform their own individual ring ceremonies. When a Yokozuna
					 performs his ring ceremony, he will wear a white tsuna, or zuna (braided rope with five zig-zag strips hanging from the
					 front ), around his waist to signify his rank. Once the actual bouts begin, the two rikishi spend several minutes
					 before their match lifting their legs high in the air and stomping them down, a practice said to scare away any demons.
					 They also throw several handfuls of salt into the ring, which is said to purify the ring. Many rikishi will also sprinkle
					 salt around their bodies as a means of protecting them from injury. After the last bout of the day, the yumi-tori
					 (bow twirling) ceremony is performed by a makushita-ranked rikishi from the same stable as a Yokozuna. True fans of
					 the sport will not leave their seats until this ritual is performed. Presently, sumo consists of six major tournaments
					 a year called hon-basho. The tournament months and sites are as follows: January-Tokyo, March-Osaka, May-Tokyo,
					 July-Nagoya, September-Tokyo, and November-Fukuoka. Up through the early 20th century, there were only two basho a year;
					 however, as sumo's popularity grew, the number of major tournaments increased to four basho a year and then in 1958,
					 the current six-basho-a-year format was established. Also, up until 1949 a basho only lasted for 10 days; currently a
					 basho runs for 15 days. In between basho, the rikishi constantly keep busy by touring the outskirts of Japan giving
					 exhibitions for fans who might otherwise not get a chance to see the sport up close and live. This touring is called
					 jungyo, and while the rikishi do battle each other in front of the fans, they are more concerned about avoiding injury
					 than winning. This type of exhibition sumo is called hana-sumo, or flower sumo. Throughout the history of the sport,
					 there is record of only 70 rikishi having ever been crowned as Yokozuna. Currently #69 Hakuho and #70 Harumafuji are
					 actively fighting. Often, sumo eras are defined by the Yokozuna who fought in them. In order to receive promotion to the
					 rank of Yokozuna nowadays, a rikishi must win two tournaments in a row. To emphasize how difficult this task is, out of
					 the hundreds of thousands of youngsters to have ever stepped in the ring only 70 have ever reached the pinnacle. In times
					 past when there were no active Yokozuna, exceptions to the two tournament rule were made if a rikishi won one tournament
					 and then followed that performance up with a record "worthy" of a Yokozuna. Another fascinating aspect of sumo are the
					 daily practice sessions (called keiko) just prior to and during the major tournaments. Practice begins around 5:00 am
					 for the lowest ranked rikishi and starts with stretching followed by actual practice bouts in a makeshift ring. The most
					 common form of keiko is called moshi-ai-geiko. This form of keiko is basically winner stays in the ring until someone can
					 beat him. As soon as one bout ends, every rikishi at the practice session is expected to rush into the ring towards the
					 winner in hopes that he will be chosen as his next opponent. There is no formal teaching of holds or maneuvers; rather,
					 the rikishi learn these themselves by watching their seniors and practicing endlessly. The higher-ranked a rikishi is,
					 the later in the morning he may enter the practice ring. The Makuuchi rikishi usually arrive at the practice session at
					 8:30 am and bark out instructions to their inferiors as they stretch ringside. As the higher-ranked rikishi begin their
					 practice, those of lower ranks are busy in the kitchen preparing the first meal of the day</p>
